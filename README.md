# terraform-azure-chef

Hopefully, this repo will be used to provision an instance on Azure, and then use Chef to configure the instance. 

This repo is using the Chef SaaS server here: https://api.chef.io/organizations

To be able to access the web server, you will need to add a rule in Azure to allow you to hit port 80.
